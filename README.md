# WaheedAfolabi-HNG

<p>Here's my personal repo created as part of the process for selection
into HNG Internship 5 by Mike Essien.</p>

<p>I believe I have what it takes to get in.</p>

<p>Let's see how it goes</p>

## Why Join this?

<p>This is a question every way farer should ask in order<br>
not get lost in their quest.</p>

<p>Same applies to me. I want to get along with world best software engineers<br>
to become one of them.</p>

<p>What I learn along the journey will be of great importance. My aim is to get all the way in.
Nothing short of this. Nothing less.</p>

** God help me **
